# Overview
The modern japanese writing system uses a combination of logographic kanji,
which are adopted chinese characters and syllabic kana. Almost all written
japanese sentences contain a mixture of kanji and kana.

## Kana
Kana itself consists of a pair of syllabaries: hiragana, used primarily
for native or naturalised Japanese words and grammatical elements; and
katakana, used primarily for foreign words and names, loanwords, 
onomatopeia, scientific names, and sometimes for emphasis. 

In modern japanese, the hiragana and katakana syllabaries each contain 
46 basic characters, or 71 including diacritics. With one or two minor
exceptions, each different sound in the Japanese language corresponds
to one character in each syllabary.

## Kanji
Several thousand kanji characters are in regular use. Each characters has
an intrinsic meaning (or range of meanings), and most have more than one
pronunciation, the choice of which depends on context.

## R≈çmaji
The romanization of Japanese is the use of Latin script to write the 
Japanese language.

## Arabic numerals
Arabic numerals (as opposed to traditional kanji numerals) are often used to
write numbers in horizontal text, especially when numbering things rather than
indicating a quantity, such as telephone numbers, serial numbers, and addresses.
